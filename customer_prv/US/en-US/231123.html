<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span lang=EN-US><br>
7. How long will LGE keep my personal information?<br>
<br>
We will take reasonable steps to make sure that we keep your personal
information for no longer than is necessary for us to provide you with LG gram
Link App or for the purpose for which it was collected, or as required by
applicable law.<br>
<br>
We apply criteria to determine the appropriate retention period for different
categories of personal information you provide us with. For example, we will
keep information necessary to protect us in a legal claim, such as information
relating to a contract, for the lifetime of the contract and up to <u>seven
years</u> after. After this period it will be deleted or in some cases
anonymized. Where we have collected the personal information based on your
consent and we have no other lawful basis to continue with that processing, if
you subsequently withdraw your consent then we will delete your personal
information.<br>
<br>
8. Cookie Consent<br>
<br>
A cookie is a small data file, which often includes a unique device identifier
that is stored on LG gram Link App. We may use a cookie to check your connection
status for services.<br>
<br>
9. Security<br>
<br>
We use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality and
security of your personal information. Nevertheless, due to the design of the
Internet, ever-changing technology, and other factors outside of our control,
we cannot guarantee that communications between you and our servers will be
free from unauthorized access by third parties or that we will not be subject
to security breaches. We do not accept any responsibility for the disclosure of
personal information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized or unlawful
acts of third parties.<br>
<br>
10. Protecting the Privacy of Children<br>
<br>
Protecting the privacy of children is important to us. For that reason, none of
our LG gram Link App are directed at or designed to attract anyone under 16
years old. We also do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from
users who are under 16 years old. Should we learn or be notified that we have
collected information from users under the age of 16, we will promptly delete
such personal information.<br>
<br>
11. Consenting for Others<br>
<br>
In certain countries where the age of majority is older than 15, we will direct
