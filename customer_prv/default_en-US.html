6. How long will LGE keep my personal information?<br>
<br>
We will take reasonable steps to make sure that we keep your personal
information for no longer than is necessary for us to provide you with Sync On
Mobile App or for the purpose for which it was collected, or as required by
applicable law.<br>
<br>
We apply criteria to determine the appropriate retention period for different
categories of personal information you provide us with. For example, we will keep
information necessary to protect us in a legal claim, such as information
relating to a contract, for the lifetime of the contract and up to seven years
after. After this period it will be deleted or in some cases anonymized. Where
we have collected the personal information based on your consent and we have no
other lawful basis to continue with that processing, if you subsequently
withdraw your consent then we will delete your personal information.<br>
<br>
7. Cookie Consent<br>
<br>
A cookie is a small data file, which often includes a unique device identifier
that is stored on Sync On Mobile App. We may use a cookie to check connection
status for services.<br>
<br>
8. Security<br>
<br>
We use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality and
security of your personal information. Nevertheless, due to the design of the
Internet, ever-changing technology, and other factors outside of our control,
we cannot guarantee that communications between you and our servers will be
free from unauthorized access by third parties or that we will not be subject
to security breaches. We do not accept any responsibility for the disclosure of
personal information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized or unlawful
acts of third parties.<br>
<br>
9. Protecting the Privacy of Children<br>
<br>
Protecting the privacy of children is important to us. For that reason, none of
our Sync On Mobile App are directed at or designed to attract anyone under 16
years old. We also do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from
users who are under 16 years old. Should we learn or be notified that we have
collected information from users under the age of 16, we will promptly delete
such personal information.<br>
<br>
10. Consenting for Others<br>
<br>
If Sync On Mobile App will be used by other members of your household or
visitors and you agree to this Privacy Policy, you have obtained their
agreement to this Privacy Policy and are providing consent on their behalf. If
any users of Sync On Mobile App are under the age of 18, and you agree to this
Privacy Policy, you are consenting to this Privacy Policy on their behalf. <br>
<br>
11. Changes to LGE's Privacy Policy<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy may be updated by LGE from time to time. If we make a
material change to our Privacy Policy, we will update you via Sync On Mobile
App or other means. You may be required to acknowledge or agree to the revised
Privacy Policy in order to continue using <span style='color:black'>certain Sync
On Mobile App.</span><br>
<br>
12. Contacting LGE about this Privacy Policy<br>
<br>
If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or LGE</span>’<span
lang=EN-US>s processing of your personal information, please submit your
questions or comments via e-mail [lg-synconmobile@lge.com]. You also have the right
to lodge a complaint with the data protection authority in the country in which
you reside, although we would encourage you to first contact us directly to
resolve any concerns. <br>
<br>
13. Access and Control of Personal Information<br>
<br>
You have the right to request we delete, access, update, and correct
inaccuracies in your personal information in our custody and control, and to
receive a copy of your personal information, subject to certain exceptions
prescribed by law. You also have the right to object to the manner in which we
use your personal information (including for direct marketing purposes) and to
withdraw any consent you have granted us. You may exercise these rights any
time by emailing or writing to us at the contact information set out above. We may
request certain personal information for the purposes of verifying the identity
of the individual seeking access to their personal information records.<br>
<br>
14. Assignment<br>
<br>
In the event that all or part of our assets are sold or acquired by another
party, or in the event of a merger, you grant us the right to assign the
information collected via your use of Sync On Mobile App.<br>
